    "Under the hood, this notebook uses a library called **PyTerrier**. Please check out the first part of our _Introduction to PyTerrier_ series to learn how to install PyTerrier. However, you do not need to interact with PyTerrier directly for now; rather, we're providing you with simple utility functions you can use. Feel free to have a look how these are implemented, but it's not required.\n",
